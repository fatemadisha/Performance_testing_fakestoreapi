Dear, 

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App. 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server fakestoreapi.com. 

10 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 22.5 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2900
50 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 100 And Total Concurrent API requested: 29000
100 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 103 And Total Concurrent API requested: 29000
200 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 105 And Total Concurrent API requested: 58000
300 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 111 And Total Concurrent API requested: 87000

While executed 300 concurrent request, found 7 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.01%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 250 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.

Please find the details report from the attachment.
